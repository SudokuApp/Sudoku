    <!-- Instruction Strings -->
    <string name="how_to_play">How to play!</string>
    <string name="what_is_sudoku_answer">Sudoku is a number puzzle in which players insert the
        numbers 1 to 9 into a grid consisting of nine squares subdivided into a further nine
        smaller squares in such way that every number appears once in each horizontal line,
        vertical line and square.</string>
    <string name="step_1_text">The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid so that each column, each row,
        and each of the nine 3x3 boxes (also called blocks or regions) contains the digits from 1
        to 9.\nA cell is the smallest block in the game. A row , column and region consists of 9
        cells and the whole game consists of 81 cells. A region has thicker lines surrounding it.
        This simply makes it easier to play the game.</string>
    <string name="buttons_how_to">To play the game, there are buttons with the digits from 1 to 9.
        Press the number that you would like to add to the puzzle, and then the place where you
        want to put it.</string>
    <string name="button_erease_mark_how_to">To erase a number that has been put in the board,
        you can click the erase button and the number you want to erase. If there is a place on the
        board that you are not sure is right, you can mark it with the mark button. If you want to
        go back, the puzzle will be saved, so you can continue later on with the same puzzle.</string>
    <string name="first_rule_how_to">Let\'s get into the rules of the game. As the picture below
        shows, the goal of the game is to fill all empty cells with the correct digits. In this
        case, we have found a place for 9 on the board. We see that it is correct because all of
        the other empty cells in the box can\'t have 9 in it (as shown with the green line).</string>
    <string name="second_rule_how_to">In the picture below we can see that the 2 with the circle
        around it is misplaced. The box already has a 2 in it.</string>
    <string name="third_rule_how_to">In the last picture the 8 in the red circle is misplaced,
        because there is another 8 in the same row (as shown with the red line).</string>
    <string name="fourth_rule_how_to">The last and the most important rule is to enjoy the game
        and have fun. So go and enjoy! \n\nArnbjörg, Haraldur, Hreiðar and Þórný</string>
